# Postgres Image with Ansible

This image is meant for local development use. We add in Ansible so we can take
advantage of Ansible to restore data to the development database.

See <example/> for sample files of how to use this image in your own project.

## TODO

* [ ] Describe `ansible/` diretory within project
* [ ] Describe how to use local ansible vars to store environment specific
  settings
